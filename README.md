## :dart: About ##

<h1>The Project.</h1>
<p>This project was born with the proposal to be a practical and solid way to practice all the contents learned in the Computer Networks Administration course, which aims to bring an understanding of subjects such as programming languages â€‹â€‹and algorithms; computer network technologies and protocols; general knowledge of the computer's functionality.</p>

<p>The central idea of â€‹â€‹the project is built around the development of a web application for games using programming techniques and communication technologies.. (P.B.BERTOTTI-11/2020)</p>

<h1>Technologies.</h1>
<p>Thought as a web platform game, it will be all programmed in js, also using programs to generate scenarios and characters. Our role will be to assemble and manage the codes.</p>

<h1>The game!</h1>
<p>The game's proposal will be a multiplayer speed run of choices, named as "The Maze of Choices", in which your objective is to reach the end before your opponent. Starting with a simple choice, PRESS START, from that choice, you will fall into the maze, and from there, run. </p>

<p>The game will have an environment based on the game "The legend of the zelda - The minish cap", all in 16bit.</p>
